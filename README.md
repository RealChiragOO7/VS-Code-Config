# Make Coding Easy

**This tutorial is for linux (debian based) only. <br>
If you are a windows user then check this out [Setup VS Code for windows](windows.md)**

# 1. **VS code task config** to make **competitive programming** easy and **programme analysis** ! <br>

[This](/Config-Files/C&C++/Linux/tasks.json) is a **.json** file which will help you to run your **cpp** file with one **click** or **shortcut**.

In this case , you **don't** need to write **input** in the command line or write **fopen** / **close** stuffs , programme will take input from a file **(input.txt)** automatically and give the output in another file **(output.txt)**.

![Input Output](images/input&output.png)

You can also find the programme **runtime status** which will help you to calculate **execution time** as well as **memory usage** and many more! 

![Time Status](images/time_status.png)

pre-requirements :

- Visual Studio Code
- gcc/g++
- time
- install time : `sudo apt install time`

## Let's setup

Note : **You just need to do these things only for the first time of your workspace!**

- Split screen in 3 sections

  - split the main section in right (right mouse click on the .cpp file and u will get the split options)
  - then split the right into down (same as above)

![Split SS](/images/split%20options.png)

- create a file named `input.txt` and save it in the same folder
- create a file named `output.txt` and save it in the same folder
- open input.txt into the upper right section
- open output.txt into the lower right section

#### This will be the final look of your vs code

### How to setup

- Go to Configure Default Build Task...

  - In Menu bar

    - Click on Terminal (At the left top bar )
      ![Top Bar](/images/top_bar.png)
    - select configure task
    - select create task.json from template (this will create a task.json file in .vscode in your working directory)
    - select other and new task.json file will be created
    - now copy and paste the `task.json` { [link is here](/Config-Files/C&C++/Linux/tasks.json) } file into your `task.json` file
    - done

## Usage

- Run :
  - Shortcut type : **`ctrl+shift+b`**
- You need to give the input in the **input.txt** file
- output will be shown in the **output.txt** file

**Note :** Make sure your mouse cursor is **clicked** or **focused** on the **cpp file** editor while you are running your code.

- **Bonus** : programme status will be shown in the **sys.txt** file
- People concern about more details such as **binary form** and **disassemble code** can check `tasks(extra).json` file [Link](</Config-Files/C&C++/Linux/tasks(extra).json>)

# In the Repository i have also added *config* files for other Programming Languages too

- `task.json` files for :

  - Python :

    - [Windows File](Config-Files/Python/Windows/tasks.json)
    - [Linux File](Config-Files/Python/Linux/tasks.json)

  - Java :

    - [Windows File](Config-Files/Java/Windows/tasks.json)
    - [Linux File](Config-Files/Java/Linux/tasks.json)

  - Dart :

    - [Windows File](Config-Files/Dart/Windows/tasks.json)
    - [Linux File](Config-Files/Dart/Linux/tasks.json)

  - Go :
    
    - [Linux File](Config-Files/go/Linux/tasks.json)

**Note :** Here, I have merged all the files which includes tasks.json file for Python, C, C++, Java and Dart for both Windows and Linux! [Here is the Link](/Config-Files/all-in-one/tasks.json)

# 2. VS CODE Snippet

**This one is made for my personal usage, you can add functions as you wish and edit my name and doc.**

- Select User Snippets under **File** (at Left top bar) > **Preferences (Code > Preferences on macOS)**, and then select **cpp.json**
  
  ![Top Bar](/images/top_bar.png)
  
- copy or replace the cpp.json file {[Link](/Snippets/cpp.json)} and save !

## Usage

- Creating a cpp file if you type **inc** and press **Tab** in your keyboard the **snippet** will load as i have set **prefix** as **inc** in my **json file** . (**You can edit as your own !**)
- This will make programming easy and fast .

# In the Repository i have also added *config* files for other Programming Languages too

- **Snippets** for :

  - [C/C++](/Snippets/cpp.json)
  - [Python](/Snippets/python.json)
  - [Dart](/Snippets/dart.json)
  - [Java](/Snippets/java.json)

## Happy Coding with VS Code
